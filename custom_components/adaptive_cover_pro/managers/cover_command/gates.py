"""Pure delta/time gate checks for cover_command.

Decisions only — every input the gate needs is passed in. The orchestrator
(:class:`CoverCommandService`) does the HA-side reads (current position,
last-updated timestamp) and hands the values to these functions, which
keeps the gates trivially unit-testable and free of HA imports.

Why pre-fetched values rather than callbacks: tests historically patch
``managers.cover_command.get_last_updated`` at the package's __init__
module path. Keeping the read inside the wrapper method lets that patch
keep working; the gate functions then operate on the (already-fetched)
values without caring where they came from.
